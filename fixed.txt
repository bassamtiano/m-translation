CREATING A HABITABLE ENVIRONMENT
Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain their lives .
Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially .
This will , if not already , cause problems as there is very limited space for us .
The solution can be obtained by using technology to achieve better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as deserts and swamps .
Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their city as they tend to get overpopulated .
This caused a problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment .
The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing a taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces .
It is also important to create better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes .
A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite a large number of earthquakes happening in there .
Besides a better usage of lands , better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their health .
